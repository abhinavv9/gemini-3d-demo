      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "index.html", "web.config" does not refer to index.html.
      To produce a "web.config" file, "react-scripts build" uses the "configuration" field of your "package.json".
